# General Workflow for Digitizing an Object

## Export: Export Process (DT BC100)

This section outlines the steps for exporting and renaming the processed object (e.g., book) images. It ensures name consistency, high-quality export formats, and organized storage of the digitized page images.

**`Commentary`:** `Clarify the meaning and context of "DT BC100" with the Digitization Team.`

### Batch Rename

Batch rename refers to the feature that allows users to rename multiple files at once. This function saves the user significant time, especially when dealing with a large number of files.

The user can choose specific naming conventions and apply them instantly across a set of files. The formats can be text, numeric, or alphanumeric based on the user's preference. The function essentially uses pattern recognition to rename files in a structured and organized manner.

The following are the steps required to perform batch renaming:

1. Click on the 'Highlight Cursor' icon located in the top ribbon pane.
2. Navigate to and 'Right-Click' on the thumbnail photo and select `Batch Rename`. Alternatively, 'Right-Click' on the empty space of the scanned image and select `Batch Rename`.

   **`Commentary`:** `Clarify what is meant by the "empty space of the scanned image" in this context.`

3. Change `Job Name` to an appropriate name based on the current project.

   **`Commentary`:** `Confirm the naming convention for projects with the Digitization Team. If they do not have a defined convention, recommend implementing one.`

4. **Format**: Ensure the 'Job Name_Current Date_(MMM dd yyyy)' format is adhered to and change the Digit Counter to '4'. This is mostly a default value.

   **`Commentary`:** `Explain the 'Job Name_Current Date_(MMM dd yyyy)' format in more detail.`

5. Click on `...` located in the top right of the window and select `Set Rename Counter`.
6. Set the value to **2** since scanned images will increase in this manner.
   > **NOTE:** The user on the left workstation will change in an even number order (2, 4, 6).
7. Click on `...` in the top right and select `Set Rename Counter Increment`: This should be set to **2** as the increments increase in this manner.
8. Navigate to the bottom right corner of the window and click on **'Rename'**.
- If prompted that the specified RAWs and JPEGs should be paired, click on **`Proceed`**, and the pairing process will not occur.

### Export Recipes

Export Recipes is a feature that enables users to save specific sets of export settings. This tool can be particularly useful for individuals who frequently reuse the same settings, such as color, contrast, resolution, and file type. Saved export recipes allow for quicker and more efficient image processing, eliminating the need to manually adjust settings each time a scan is performed.

Users can create multiple different export recipes depending on the scenarios and reuse them as required.

Below highlights how a user may go about this:

- Navigate to the export tool icon located at the top of the tool pane on the left.
- Under the '**`Export Location`**' pane on the left, rename the '**`Subfolder`**' according to the current project (e.g., Team11_Image Date MM DD YYYY).
- Select the `Export Recipes` tile located on the upper left of the window pane and select `TIFF-Adobe RGB-16 bit` as this is the default setting for most small format projects. It should be highlighted in **orange**.
- Confirm in `Pictures` that the files have been successfully exported.

### Export Format & Size

The Export format and size functionality in Image Scanning software refers to the customization of the final output file format and size.

Users can choose between various options, depending on the final use of the image. For example, **JPEGs** might be selected for their smaller file size, whereas **TIFF** and **PNG** formats may be more suitable for high-resolution needs.

The size of the exported image can be altered according to user preference, factoring in considerations such as storage capacity and the requirements of the platform where the image will be used.

See below:

- Change the bit depth to **16 bit** as this is the default setting.
- Set the resolution: This can be either **400 PPI** for larger format materials or **600 PPI** (Books and Maps). This also is dependent on the photo pixel density.

**`Commentary`:** `Clarify with the Digitization Team the recommended file type(s) and resolution(s) for different types of materials (e.g., books, maps, larger format materials). Additionally, define what constitutes "larger format material" in this context.`

### Export Location

The Export Location feature allows users to select the destination where the processed files will be saved post-scanning. The location can be a specific folder on the local system or even a cloud-based storage service. This precise control over file organization helps in efficient storage and easier access to the scanned images.

Users can save different types of scans to different locations based on their workflow or departmental needs.

- Subfolder naming: Use the following pattern 'jobname-name of item'.
- Click **`Export`**.

Find the exported image by following these steps:

1. Navigate to 'FINDER' which is usually one of the tiles using the shortcut keys, `Command` + `tab`. While holding the `Command` key, continue to tap the `tab` key to cycle through different options.
- Alternatively, use the shortcut keys, `Command` + `Spacebar` to access 'Spotlight' and then type 'Finder' followed by enter into the input box which has appeared on the screen.
2. Navigate to 'Pictures' and find your project name and select 'Output'.
3. Drag and drop the image file(s) to the 'FINAL_Export File'.
4. Move the 'FINAL_Export' file to its respective Storage.

**`Commentary`:** `Consult with the Digitization Team to document any specific file organization and storage best practices, including folder structure and naming conventions.`

**Additional Considerations / Summarized Commentary:**
- Review this section with the Digitization Team to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the instructions provided.
- Identify any additional information or clarification needed, such as exceptions or special cases in the export process.
- Consult relevant stakeholders to validate the validity of this documentation section and identify any other considerations that should be added.
