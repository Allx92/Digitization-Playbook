# Digitization Team: General Overview for Expected Workflow

This document speaks to the general workflow digitizing an object.

This workflow can be subdivided into four main parts.
1. Morning
2. Pre Flight
3. Digitizing Process
4. Export

## Morning
This section outlines the essential steps the Digitization Team members should follow each morning to prepare their workspace and set up the capture software. 

## Pre Flight

## Digitizing Process
