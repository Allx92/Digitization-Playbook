This section will outline the steps for exporting and renaming the processed object uding the DT Versa It ensures name consistency, high-quality export format, and organized storage of the digitized book page images.

**Follow the steps described below to successfully execute the export process.**

## 4.1 Batch Rename 

Batch rename refers to the feature that allows users to rename multiple files at once. This function saves the user significant amount of time, especially when dealing with a large number of files. The user can choose specific naming conventions and apply them instantly across a set of files. The formats can be text, numeric or alphanumeric based on the the user's preference. The function essentially uses pattern recognition to rename files in a structured and organized manner.

 1. Highlight Cursor Icon located in the Top ribbon pane.

 2. Navigate to and '**Right-click**' on the thumbnail photo and select `Batch Rename`

    -(Alternatively) 'Right click' on empty space of scanned image and select `Batch Rename`
 3. Change `Job Name` to an appropriate name based on current project.

 4. **Format**: Ensure 'Job Name_Current Date (MMM dd yyyy)' format is adhered to and change the Digit Counter to '4' ???

 5. Cick on '...' located to the top right of window and select `Set Rename Counter`
6. <span style="color:#7CD2FD">Set value to **'1'** since scanned images will increase in this manner</span>.
 > **NOTE:**  The user of left workstation  will use page 1,  while the user of the right workstation will use page 2. The user of workstation 1 scans images in an odd number order (1,3,5), while the user of workstation 2 scans the images in an even number order (2,4,6).
 
 7. Click on '...' to the top right and select  `Set Rename Counter Increment`: This should be set to **1** as the increments increase in this manner.
 
 8. Navigate to the bottom right corner of window and click on  **'Rename'**.
 
    -If prompted that the specified RAWs and JPEGs should be paired, click on **'Proceed'** but the pairing process will not occur.

## 4.2 Export Recipes

Export Recipes is a feature that enables users to save specific sets of export settings. This tool can be particularly useful for individuals who frequently reuse the same settings such as color, contrast, resolution and file type. Saved export recipes allow for quicker and more efficient image proecesses, eliminating the need to manually adjust settings each time a scan is performed. Users can create multiple different export recipes depending on the scenarios and reuse them as required. Below highlights how a user may go about this:

- Navigate to the export tool icon located at the top of the tool pane on the left.

- Under '**Export Location**' pane on the left, rename the '**Subfolder**' according to the current project Eg.(RK11_Image_Date MM DD YYYY)
- Select `Export Recipes` tile located on the upper left of window pane and select `TIFF-Adobe RGB-16 bit` as this is the default setting for this transmissible object. It should be highlighted in **orange**
- Confirm in `Pictures` that the files have been successfully exported.

## 4.3 Export Format & Size

The Export format and size functionality in Image Scanning software refers to the customization of the final output file format and size. Users can choose between various options, depending on what their final use of the image. For example, **JPEGs** might be selected for their smaller file size, whereas **TIFF** and **PNG** formatis may be more suitable for high resolution needs.The size of the exported image can be altered according to user preference, factoring in considerations such as storage capacity and the requirements of the platform where the image will be used. See below:

- Change bit depth to **16 bit** as this is the default setting
- Set the resolution: This should be set to <span style="color:#7CD2FD">**4000 PPI**</span> for the transmissive target. This is dependent on the photo pixel density.

## 4.4 Export Location

The Export Location feature allows users to select the destination where the preocessed files will be saved post-scanning. The location can be a specific folder on the local system or even cloud based storage service. This precise control over file organization helps in efficient storage and easier access of the scanned images, Users can save different types of scans to different locations based on their workflow or departmental needs

- Subfolder naming: Use the following pattern 'jobname-name of item'.
- Click **'Export'**.

Find the exported image by following these steps:

1. Navigate to 'FINDER' which is the second tile using `Command+tab` shortcut key.
2. Navigate to 'Pictures' and find your project name and select 'Output'.
3. Drag and drop the image file/s to the FINAL_Export File.
4. Move 'FINAL_Export' file  to its respective Storage.
