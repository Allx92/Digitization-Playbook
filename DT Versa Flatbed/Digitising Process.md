# DT Versa Flatbed Scanner Documentation

> ### This section aims to provide insight and guidance into the process of digtizing objects, it describes the steps to capture and the method to do so.

## Image Capturing Procedure


Before you start the scanning process, carefully follow the steps listed below:

1. **Remove the target tray:** Start by removing the tray from the scanner.

2. **Adjust the transmissive carrier:** This involves changing the size of the transmissive carrier to match the size of the items you want to capture.

3. **Place items in the carrier:** Position the items to be scanned in the transmissive carrier with caution to avoid any potential damage.

4. **Open the live view:** On your scanner software, open the live view feature. Make certain that all items are situated between given guidelines. Keeping the top of the image facing the bottom of the carrier will ensure the best scanning results.

5. **Shut the side flaps:** Close the side flaps on the scanner. This eliminates any excess light from the sides that may interfere with the image capture process.

6. **Repeat if necessary:** If there are more items to be scanned, repeat steps 1-5 until you have captured all items.

## Post Scanning: Production Settings

The steps in this section guide you on how to adjust your scanner settings to prepare the images for archiving or other uses.

1. **Access the Production tab:** Locate and click on the 'Production' tab within your scanner software. This is where you can make all the necessary adjustments for your digitized images.

2. **Select the Images:** To select the images you wish to edit, view your images in 'Browser' view. Left-click on the first image you want to adjust, then hold down the 'Shift' key and select the last image. This will allow you to select all your scanned images at once.

3. **Crop and straighten your images:**

   - *Activate the Crop tool:* Located among the cursor tools in your software, select the 'Crop' tool.

   - *Set the Crop Ratio:*
     In the cropping settings, set the 'Crop Ratio' to 'unconstrained'. This will provide greater flexibility when cropping your images.

   - *Set the Auto Crop:*
     Enable the 'Auto Crop' feature to allow the software to automatically cut away the unnecessary parts of your images.

   - *Choose the Method:*
     If you are scanning materials that are bound together, select the 'bound material' option under 'Method'.

   - *Strighten your Images:*
     Under the 'Straighten' settings, select 'Average'. This feature will align your images correctly according to an average alignment.

   - *Apply Padding:*
     In order to create a clean and refined look, apply a padding setting of 100 pixels to your images.

4. **Conduct a focus check:** The sharpness of your images is incredibly important, particularly in corner areas. Thus, use the 'Focus Tool' in your scanning software to ensure all four corners of every image are clear and distinct.

With these steps, you should have high-quality, clear images ready for archive or whatever their next use may be.
