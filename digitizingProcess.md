# DIGITISING PROCESS
The digitising process involves capturing images of documents, books, maps etc using specific equipment settings. 

## Setup and Capture
This segment guides you through configuring the equipment for accurate image capture and systematically digitizing documents, books etc. 

1. **Cradle Preparation:**
- Get started by using the right foot pedal to raise the cradle glass.
- Next, **gently** pull the joystick back to lower the cradle into place until it slots into the base.
- Once the cradle is lowered, place your object in the cradle, ensuring proper positioning.
