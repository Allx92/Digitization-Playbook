# Pre-Flight Workflow (BC 100)

Before starting the capture process, ensure that the camera settings are configured properly, which includes camera resolution, focus, LCC, white balance, and exposure, so that images are an accurate reproduction of the original item.

## Base characteristics
The base characteristics are how the system is supposed to be configured at the start of the preflight.
Before beginning the preflight procedure, ensure that the following base characteristics are set:

1. **Mode:** Navigate to the Base Characteristics tool panel. Ensure the Mode is set to ***photography***
2. **LCC profile:** In the same panel, check the *LCC Profile* is set to ***Phase One iXH 150MP Flat Art***
3. **Curve:** In the same panel, check that *Curve* is set to **Linear Scientific** 
4. Check that *reproduction* is set to **LED DTPortion**


## Live View 
Live View provides a real-time display of what the camera lens is capturing, allowing for adjustments to composition and sharpness. This ensures that the final image meets desired standards before capture.

1. **Set Camera Resolution:** Set camera two Resolution to PPI-600 and open live view  
2. **Auto-focus (AF):** Under the camera Focus panel select *AF*. Drag the prompt to target to lock focus.
3. **Capture:** Command K or window key or hand pedal
4. **Zoom in:** Using the zoom controls or keyboard shortcuts zoom in to the 600 mark on the target until the 5 resolution lines are visible.
5. **Capture:** Press caputure to confrim adjustments.


4. ## LCC board (white board) 
The LCC board is used along with the software to correct lens cast, which is produced by uneven lighting across the frame. The LCC board is placed parallel above the glass plate matching the angle of the object being photograph. The LCC board must fill the frame before capturing. 

1. **Prepare LCC board:** Get the LCC board 
2. **Position Board:** Place the board parallel to glass and cover the frame. 
3. **Capture:** Press Capture in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut. 
4. **Add Colour Readout:** Ensure the color readout in the middle reads 60 or 70. 
5. **Check Readouts:** Make sure readouts in all four corners match the middle.
6. **Adjust Shutter Speed:** If readouts exceeds 70 make the necessary changes adjustments to the shutter speed.
7. **Create LCC:** In the LCC panel, select *Create LCC* and capture the target.  

## White balance
This process adjusts the colour of the photos captured to accurately represent how they appear in real life under the LCC lighting conditions. Ensuring whites appear truly white rather than a tinted colour.

1. **Delete Readouts:** Right click on the readouts and select delete all
2. **Zoom In:** Using the zoom controls zoom in on the target to colour patch 70 (value changes based on target) and click on it. 

## Exposure 
Exposure adjustmenst are based on the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor, and is determined by the shutter speed, aperture and ISO.

1. **Check Readouts:** Ensure readouts are within the expected (e.g., close to the colour patch value, ideally 70 but 69.0 is acceptable)
2. **Add Readouts:** In the cursor tools section, select the *color editor tool*, and from the dropdown list, select *Add Color Readout* to add readouts to first 6 patches (Patch 70 - 95)
3. **Adjust Shutter Speed:** Navigate to the Exposure tool and change shutter speed to match the correct values, typically adjusting to 1/20 or 1/5 (trigger speed) 
4. **Coordinate Exposure Settings:** One system does the white balance first, providing the second operator with their setting values. Ensure communication between operators for consistent setting values.
