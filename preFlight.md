# Pre-Flight Workflow (BC 100)

Before starting the capture process, the Pre-Flight workflow ensures that the camera settings are configured properly, which includes camera resolution, focus, LCC, white balance, and exposure, so that images are an accurate reproduction of the original object.

## Base characteristics
The base characteristics are how the system is supposed to be configured at the start of the Pre-Flight.

1. To begin, click on the **capture button** under the Pre-Flight tool tab, located in the Camera settings.
2. **Base Characteristics:**
- **Mode:** Ensure the *Mode* is set to **photography**.
- **ICC profile:** In the same panel, check the *LCC Profile* is set to **Phase One iXH 150MP Flat Art LED DTPortion**.
- **Curve:** In the same panel, also check that *Curve* is set to **Linear Scientific**.

## Live View 
Live View provides a real-time display of what the camera lens is capturing, allowing for adjustments to composition and sharpness. This ensures that the final image meets desired standards before capture.

1. To enter **Live View** mode click on the **Live View button** under the Pre-Flight tool tab.

2. **Set Camera Resolution:** Under the **Camera Focus** panel, set the camera *Resolution* to *600-PPI*.
3. **Auto-focus (AF):** In the same panel, select *AF* to allow the software to automtically adjust the camera len focus based on the selected focus point. Drag the prompt to target to lock focus, if necessary.

4. **Capture:** Use window key + K or the hand pedal to capture the target.
5. **Zoom in:** Using the zoom slider or keyboard shortcuts, zoom in to the 600 mark on the target until the 5 resolution lines are visible.

6. **Capture:** Press capture to confirm adjustments.

## LCC board (white board) 
The LCC board is used along with the software to correct lens cast, which is produced by uneven lighting across the frame. The LCC board is placed parallel above the glass plate matching the angle of the object being photograph. 

The LCC board must fill the frame before capturing. 
1. **Prepare LCC board:** Get the LCC board.

2. **Position Board:** Place the board parallel to the glass, and ensure the LCC board covers the Live View frame.
3. **Capture:** Press Capture in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut.

4. **Add Colour Readout:** Go to the cursor toolbar and select **Add Color Readout**. Add the *Color Readouts* to the four corners and middle of the LCC board, ensure the *Color Readout* in the middle of the target reads **60** or **70**.

5. **Check Readouts:** Make sure *Readouts* in all four corners match the middle.
6. **Adjust Shutter Speed:** If readouts exceeds 70 make the necessary changes adjustments to the shutter speed.

7. **Create LCC:** In the LCC panel, select *Create LCC* and capture the target.  

## White balance
This process adjusts the colour of the photos captured to accurately represent how they appear in real life under the LCC lighting conditions. Ensuring whites appear truly white rather than a tinted colour.

1. **Delete Readouts:** Right click on one of the readouts and select delete all to remove.

2. **Add white balance:** Under *White Balance* in the left pane select the picker (eyedropper) to apply the **White Balance**.
3. **Zoom In:** Using the zoom controls zoom in on the target to colour patch **70** (value changes based on target) and click on it.
4. **Coordinate Exposure Settings:** One system does the white balance first, providing the second operator with their setting values. Ensure communication between operators for consistent setting values. 

## Exposure 
Exposure adjustmenst are based on the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor, and is determined by the shutter speed, aperture and ISO.

1. **Check Readouts:** Ensure readouts are within the expected range (e.g., close to the colour patch value, ideally 70 but 69.0 is acceptable)
2. **Add Readouts:** In the cursor tools section, select the *color editor tool*, and from the dropdown list, select *Add Color Readout* to add readouts to first 6 patches (Patch 70 - 95)

  > [!Note]
> Ensure that Readouts are placed in the middle of the color patch for an accurate Readout.

3. **Adjust Shutter Speed:** Navigate to the camera settings in the PreFlight tab to change the shutter speed to match the correct values, typically adjusting to 1/20 or 1/5 (trigger speed).
4. **Capture:** Capture to save the setting adjustments as you go.
