# Morning Routine and Software Setup

This section outlines the essential steps the Digitization Team members should follow each morning to prepare their workspace and set up the capture software, including its generic presets.

## 1. General Workplace Preparation

1. **Arrival Time:** Arrive at the work on time, ready to begin your shift. The current best practice is considered to be ten (10) minutes ahead of the time designated for your shift.

2. **Check-In Procedures:** Follow the building's security protocols for checking in personal belongings and entering the designated workspaces. This involves checking in with security when entering the building and follow the established protocols for signing into work, which incudes storing relevant items in the specified locations, such as the bag depot.

3. **Safety Precautions:**
- Remove any jewelry or functional pieces (e.g. watches) that could get caught in, or damage objects or equipment such as the glass section of the cradle. Confirm with your designated authority the best practices for storing these pieces.
- Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before starting any work. Refrain from using hand sanitizers, oils, creams, moisturizers, or any other products that may contaminate or deteriorate the objects being handled.
- Avoid touching your face or other potential sources of contaminants, as the oils can contaminate the objects and materials.
    - If contamination is unavoidable, wash and dry your hands immediately afterwards.

4. **Hygiene:**
    - Do not carry any liquids or food items into the workspace. All such items should be left at their specified location which your designated authority will specify.
    - When eating, please do so in the specified location, currently the canteen.

## 2. Hardware Setup

1. **Workspace Covering:**
- Approach the left side of your assigned workstation.
- Unzip the protective covering from the bottom, moving upwards to gain access to the hardware.

2. **Down Lights:**
- Turn on the down lights for the workstation from the power supply labeled "Digital Transitions Heritage".
- Locate the power switch on the extreme left, labeled "POWER."
- When turning on the power supply, confirm the following:
    - Two orange LEDs are lit, indicating it's on.
    - The switches with options for 'flash' and 'continuous' is set to 'continuous'.
    - The dial labeled "FLASH" is set to **`+2.3`**.
    - The dial labeled "DIM" is set to **`min`**.

3. **Computers:**
- Turn on the two computers by pressing their power buttons located at the back of the units on the extreme left.
- Confirm that all cables currently connected to the computers are secure.

4. **Workspace Covering:** Re-zip the protective covering, and access the needed equipment from the front of the workstation when following the next steps.

5. **Cameras:**
- Prepare the cameras by plugging in the relevant loose cables into the ports at the back of the cameras, ensuring the red dots on the cables align with the red dots on the camera ports.
- Unscrew and remove the lens caps carefully, without harming the lenses underneath.

4. **System Checks:** Perform a system check to ensure all equipment is functioning properly.

5. **Software Settings:**

The `Base Characteristics` settings are **pre-configured** for optimal capture quality, while further details can be found in the Pre-Flight section of the software, as well as the documentation.

Under normal circumstances, you will not need to manually insert these values.

- **`Base Characteristics`:**
    - **`Mode`:** Photography
    - **`ICC Profile`:** Phase One iXH 150 MP Flat Art LED `DTPortion`
    - **`Curve`:** Linear Scientific

Under System Check section
- **Sharpening and Noise Reduction:**
    - **`Sharpening`:**
        - Amount: 90
        - Radius: 0.8
    - **`Noise Reduction`:**
        - Details: 50
        - Colour: 40

6. **Retrieving Materials:** Locate the Librarian (or the appropriate personnel) for assistance in retrieving the materials you'll be digitizing.

7. **Material Placement:** Place the materials you'll be working with in the designated cradle.

8. **Assistance:** Throughout this process, if you encounter any difficulties or have questions about specific steps, don't hesitate to ask a more experienced team member for assistance.
