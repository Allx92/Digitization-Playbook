# Troubleshooting Guide for dt BC100 Scanner & dt Versa Flatbed Scanner

This guide will assist the operator in troubleshooting common problems associated with the DT BC100 Scanner and the DT Versa Flatbed Scanner.

## Common Problems and Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Station 1 (Green Tint in Live View on Left and Right Screen):

**Issue Description**: At times, while operating the device, you might notice that your Live View shows a green tint.

</figure>
<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc1">
  <p>Base Characteristics</p>
</div>


**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- To correct this, you need to manually adjust the colour settings.
- To do so, locate the 'tool' tab on the top panel of the software interface.
- Find and click on the 'colorcast' tool located at the top in cursor tools.
- After this, click on the image displaying in the Live View. This should correct the unwanted green tint.

### 2. Station 2 (Red Colour from LCC Board Capture and Workspace Issues):

<figcaption>Base Characteristics</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc1">
  <p>Base Characteristics</p>
</div>


**Issue Description**: The image appears to be clipping (excessive light) and there might be sudden spurts of red colour. Also, the colour readouts often record incorrect measurements. When you try to correct this, a persistent 'Red Cast' appears  whenever you try to change exposure settings. In addition to this, the workspace does not retain its settings and every time you reopen it, you have to add the System Check Tool and Export Tool.

**Current Solution Status**: Currently, there is no definitive solution for this issue. However, we are researching and working tirelessly to solve this problem. We advise you to keep your software updated for any future fixes.

### 3. Camera Not Detected Issue:

**Issue Description**: Sometimes, the workstation may not detect the camera. This can happen due to several reasons like hardware malfunctioning, issues with the software's camera drivers, or the camera might not be securely connected to the workstation.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:

**Solution 1 (Camera)**:

- The first solution might sound simple, but it is quite effective.
- Power off the camera by disconnecting it from the power source (unplug)
- After waiting for a moment, power it on again. This will reset the camera's internal systems and can often correct any detection issues.

**Solution 2 (Computer)**:

![Preflight Proc 1](https://github.com/Allx92/Digitization-Playbook/blob/main/images/Restart%20Computer%202%20.png){ width="550px" data-title="Base Characteristics" data-description=".custom-desc1"}
<figcaption>Base Characteristics</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc1">
  <p>Base Characteristics</p>
</div>
- If the issue persists even after restarting the camera, then there could be a problem with the workstation's software that leverages the scanner.
- In such cases, restart your computer.
- This would reset the system processes and could also update the cameraâ€™s drivers, solving the detection problem.

Please note that troubleshooting steps may vary depending on your workstation. If your issues persist after trying the given solutions, please contact your device's support for further assistance.
