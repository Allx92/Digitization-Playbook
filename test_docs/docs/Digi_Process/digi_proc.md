    The digitizing process involves capturing images of documents, books, maps, etc. using specific equipment settings. 

    ## Setup and Capture
    This segment guides you through configuring the equipment for accurate image capture and systematically digitizing those objects. 

    1. **Cradle Preparation:**
    - Get started by using the right foot pedal to raise the cradle glass.
    - Next, **gently** pull the joystick back to lower the cradle into place until it slots into the base.
    - Once the cradle is lowered, place your object in the cradle, ensuring proper positioning.
    - Add two small targets next to the object to help with alignment and calibration while capturing the image.
    - Use the left foot pedal and cradle handle to stabilize the cradle glass.
    - Raise the cradle with the joy stick by pushing the joystick forward until it meets the glass **gently**.

    !!! note
        The right foot pedal raises the cradle glass, the left foot pedal lowers the cradle glass and the joystick moves the cradle.

    2. **Image Capture:**
    - Capture the image, then **gently** lower the cradle to release the pressure.
    - Lift the cradle glass, then turn the page, and repeat the process for each image.

    ## Production Settings
    This section covers the adjustments needed to prepare the digitized images for later use, making it easy to have them available for archiving.

    1. **Enter Production Tab:** Navigate to the production tab to make adjustments and prepare the images for the next steps.
    2. **Image Selection:** In the browser view, click with the ++left-button++ on the first image for production, then hold down the ++shift++ key and use the mouse to select the last image to choose all the images in the browser view.
    3. **Crop and Straighten:**

    - Click on the *crop tool* located in the cursor tools.

    <div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc2">

    </div>

    - Set *Crop Ratio* to *unconstrained* for flexibility.

      <p>Lorem ipsum.</p>
    </div>

    - Set *Crop Image* to *Auto Crop* to automatically crop images.
    - Select *Method* and set it to *bound material* for objects that are bound together.
    - Set the *Straighten* option to *Average*.
    - Apply a padding of 100 pixels for a clean look. 
    4. **Focus Check:** Use the focus tool to ensure all four corners of the images are clear and sharp.
