# Digitization Team: Morning Routine and Software Setup Documentation

This document outlines the essential steps the Digitization Team members should follow each morning to prepare their workspace and set up the capture software. 

**What's Included:**

- General Workplace Preparation
- Software Setup

**Target Audience:**

This document is primarily for new Digitization Team members but may also prove a helpful reference for other teams working with the Digitization Team. (`**This is my assumption for the purpose of the documentation in general. Must confirm with Dr. what should go here**`).

**What's Assumed:**

We assume the reader has no prior experience with the digitization process. That said, this document does not replace the need for additional training to become proficient in the use of the equipment and software. (`**This is also my assumption for the audience of the documentation in general. Must confirm with Dr. what should go here**`)


##  General Workplace Preparation

1. **Arrive on Time:**  Make sure to arrive at work on time and ready to begin your shift.
2. **Check-In Procedures:** Follow the building's security protocols for checking in your bags and other belongings, e.g. cellphones.
3. **Safety First:**  Remove any jewelry that could get caught in equipment or damage the glass sections.
4. **Hygiene:** Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before starting any work. Remember to not use any products which may lead to contamination of the objects you will be handling. This includes (`**Confirm with trained Digitization team what should go here**`).

##  Software Setup

1. **Power Up:**  Turn on the workstation lights and connect the relevant devices. This includes the power cables for each of the cameras. Confirm that all of these connections are secure.
(`**confirm with trained Digitization team if other devices should be setup, for instance the air compressors. Should also confirm if any safety requirements are needed here, for example, I noted the team sometimes unzip the covering? for the workstation at times, is there a reason and thus protocol for this?**`).
2. **Connecting the Camera:**  Turn on the cameras and remove the lens caps.
3. **Booting Up:**  Turn on your assigned computer and enter your login credentials. (`**confirm with trained Digitization team if how this works. From what I saw, they're two computers for each station, were they assigned to a particular system? Do they have passwords and must then deal with password management? Were they given advice on software management which they must follow, e.g. updates, etc.**`)
4. **Launching Capture 1:** Open the [Capture 1](https://www.captureone.com/en) software program.
5. **Creating a New Session:**  From the `Files` menu, select `New Session`.
6. **Naming Your Session:**  Give your session a descriptive name that identifies the project you'll be working on. (`**confirm with trained Digitization team if this assumed reason is true.**`)
7. **System Check:**  Perform a system check to ensure all equipment is functioning properly (specific instructions on performing this check will be provided in training).

**Software Settings:**  (These settings are pre-configured for optimal capture quality.) (`**confirm with trained Digitization team if this assumed reason is true. Also confirm how the process for doing these steps.**`)

- **Base Characteristics Mode:** Photography
- **ICC Profile:** Phase 1
- **Camera:** iXH 150 MP Flat ARt
- **Reproduction:** LED `DTPortion` (`**What is this word?**`)
- **Curve:** Linear Scientific

**Sharpening and Noise Reduction:**  (These settings will be adjusted based on the specific document being digitized.) (`**confirm with trained Digitization team if this assumption is true.**`)

- **Sharpening:** Amount: 90, Radius: 0.8
- **Noise Reduction:** Details: 50, Colour: 40

8. **Retrieving Materials:**  Locate the Librarian (`**confirm with trained Digitization team the title and process here and the latter point.**`) for assistance in retrieving the materials you'll be digitizing. 
9. **Material Placement:**  Place the materials you'll be working with in the designated cradle. 

**Note:** Throughout this process, if you encounter any difficulties or have questions about specific steps, don't hesitate to ask a more experienced team member for assistance. (`**confirm with trained Digitization team if this is a fair assumption.**`)

**Additional Resources:**

- A glossary of terms will be provided to help you understand any technical terms used in this guide.
- Screenshots for the software setup steps may be added in a future revision of the documentation.


(`**Confirm with relevant stakeholders the validity of this documentation along with other considerations which should be added and where in the process. FOr example, environmental concerns, such as the use of food and water**`)
