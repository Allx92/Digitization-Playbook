## Camera Settings
1. **Connect Lens Cord**: Plug the silver lens cord with the **red dot** into the back of the camera.

## Light Settings

    * For scanning translucent materials (like film negatives), use the small LED light.

3. **Create New Session**:
    * Go to the "File" menu and select "New Session."
